## Build Instructions

See the [Build Instructions wiki page](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner/wiki/Build-Instructions) for information on how to build gtest-runner from source on your platform.

## Installers

Check out the [Latest release](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner/releases) for binary installers. 

_NOTE_: This is an open-source project, and as such I haven't paid for any binary signing. This means that if you install the binaries on Windows, it's going to give you a lot of pop-up warnings about potentially unsafe code. Click 'run anyway' through all of these messages to continue the installation.
